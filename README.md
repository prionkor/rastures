# Rastures

A multi-tenent restaurent reservation system. This is a demo project to showcase my skills.

## Back Story

I've been around for a long time. I have ventured various technologies, built small to large scale enterprise solutions. If you know the industry you already know that, websites recycles, businesses closes over time. So, whatever you build is no longer available in the web. If you are freelancing and get projects from another agency sometime you have to sign NDA and not allowed to share your created project in your portfolio.

That is why having open source projects are important. Yes, they don't generate money right away but they can give you exposer enough for the next big project.

So here we are!


## Technology Used

1. NextJS
2. ReactJS
3. Firebase
4. TypeScript (TS)
5. React Router DOM
6. Redux Toolkit (RTK)
7. Redux Toolkit Query (RTKQ)
8. Material UI
